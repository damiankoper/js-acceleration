\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we present analysis of popular acceleration methods in JavaScript execution environments including Chrome, Firefox, Node and Deno.  We focus evenly on adopting the same codebase to take advantage of every method, benchmarking our solutions and caveats of building libraries compatible with multiple environments. To compare performance, we use a simplified standard Hough transform algorithm. As a reference points of our benchmarks, we use sequential version of the algorithm written in both JavaScript and C++. Our study shows that Chrome is the fastest JS environment in every benchmark and Firefox is the slowest in which we identified optimization problems.  Overall WebGL appeared as the fastest and without parallel execution native C++ addon in Node is the most performant. We hope that this analysis will help to find the most efficient way to speed up execution making JavaScript a more robust environment for CPU-intensive computations.
