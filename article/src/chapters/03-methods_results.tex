\section{Methods and results}\label{sec:methods_results}

\subsection{Sequential}

TODO: Algorithm description, variants, method description, other methods are only necessary modification of this method

TODO: Accumulator difference (one pixel differs - float64 vs float32) - single figure with 4 differences referred to later

TODO: Results, C++ as reference

TODO: Notice Firefox optimization after 5th run and chrome overall better optimization

\input{charts/sequential}

TODO: Performance from devtools, show times in Math.sin and Math.cos

\input{figures/acc_differences}

\subsection{Node C++ addon}

TODO: Method description, building process

TODO: Results, C++ and Sequential as reference

\input{charts/cpp-addon}

\subsection{WebAssembly and Asm.js}

TODO: Method description, building process

TODO: Results, C++ and Sequential as reference

\input{charts/asm}

\input{charts/wasm}

\subsection{WebAssembly SIMD}

TODO: Method description, building process

\input{charts/wasm-simd-expl}

TODO: refer to accumulator differences

TODO: Instead of performance of implicit SIMD (llvm vectorization), mention that it is not better than standard WASM, but SIMD instructions are used to load/store data.

%\input{charts/wasm-simd-impl}

TODO: Performance from devtools if interesting

\subsection{Workers}

TODO: Method description, building process

TODO: Results, C++ and Sequential as reference

\input{charts/workers}

TODO: Performance from devtools

TODO: speedup math + speedup efficiency

\subsection{WebGL}

TODO: Method description, building process (minification caveats)

TODO: refer to accumulator differences

TODO: Results, C++ and Sequential as reference

\input{charts/gpu}

TODO: Performance from devtools, readpixel time factor
